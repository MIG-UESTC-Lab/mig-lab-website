I am a Ph.D. student at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Guoqing Wang. Before, I worked as an AI algorithm engineer at [East Hope Group (China)](http://www.easthope.cn/) and as a Research Associate in the [Sensors, Clouds, and Services Laboratory (SCSLab)](http://scslab.net/) at the University of Sydney.
