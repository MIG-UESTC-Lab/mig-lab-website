## üõ∞Ô∏è Intelligent Visual Capturing Systems (FLY-IN)

Designing low-level vision algorithms that enable aerial vehicles to "see" in complex conditions ‚Äî night, shining, hazy, cloudy, and rainy days. The focus is on deployment in resource-constrained edge devices on drones.

**Team Leads (rotating monthly):** Zhang Yangming, Liu Junyu, Liang Lanyue, Qiao Chaofan  
**Team Members:** Rui Quan, Xie Dongyu, Wang Zhibin, Zhang Jiening, Fan Zhuoyao, Zhou Jiayi, Hu Zixiao, Bo Wen, Zhang Huilin, Feng Yangyang

**Representative Research Topics:**
- Fly in the Dark Day (ISP imaging, Super-resolution)  
- Fly in the Hazy/Cloudy/Shining Day  
- Remote cloud removal, HDR enhancement  
- Spectral and video compression imaging  
- Task-driven joint optimization
