## üõ∞Ô∏è Intelligent Visual Capturing Systems (FLY-IN)

Designing low-level vision algorithms that enable aerial vehicles to "see" in complex conditions ‚Äî night, shining, hazy, cloudy, and rainy days. The focus is on deployment in resource-constrained edge devices on drones.

**Team Leads (rotating monthly):** Yangming Zhang, Junyu Liu, Lanyue Liang, Chaofan Qiao  
**Team Members:** Quan Rui, Dongyu Xie, Zhibin Wang, Jiening Zhang, Zhuoyao Fan, Jiayi Zhou, Zixiao Hu, Wen Bo, Huilin Zhang, Yangyang Feng

**Representative Research Topics:**
- Fly in the Dark Day (ISP imaging, Super-resolution)  
- Fly in the Hazy/Cloudy/Shining Day  
- Remote cloud removal, HDR enhancement  
- Spectral and video compression imaging  
- Task-driven joint optimization

## üß† Intelligent Visual Perception Systems (FLY-FOR)

Developing vision and multimodal large language models (LLMs) to understand the world at pixel, object, and scene level. Deployed into UAVs for object recognition, scene reconstruction, and trend prediction.

**Team Leads (rotating monthly):** Yupeng Gao, Xi Wu, Pengwei Yang, Jun Zhang  
**Team Members:** Minghang Zhou, Mingfeng Zha, Chenxi Lan, Keli Wang, Yuchen Wu, Yirui Xu, Haixia Li

**Representative Research Topics:**
- Multimodal large models for object understanding  
- Change detection, temporal reasoning  
- Salient object detection, 3D reconstruction  
- Low-speed aerial target detection  
- Semantic segmentation and few-shot learning

## ü§ñ Intelligent Embodied Aerial AI Systems (FLY-WITH)

Designing embodied visual-language navigation (VLN) and visual-language action (VLA) algorithms, enabling UAVs and multi-agent systems to interact, self-control, and self-organize autonomously.

**Team Leads (rotating monthly):** Yunqiang Pei, Kaiyue Zhang, Rongyu Du  
**Team Members:** Hongkun Chen, Ruyu Ye, Mian Zhang

**Representative Research Topics:**
- Human instruction understanding  
- Aerial agent collaboration  
- Digital twin and world modeling
